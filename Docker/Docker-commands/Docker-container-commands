docker rm containerid -- to remove container.

docker images -- list of available images

docker rmi imagename  -- to remove image 

docker pull imagename -- only pull image from docker registry

docker run imagename -- pulls and runs containername  [ if no prcess inside conatiner , it will be exited)

docker run ubuntu sleep 5 -- sleep for 5 seconds and exist the conatiner (in case if no prcess is running in conatiner)

docker exec imageinstancename cat /etc/hosts --> to know the contents for conatiner.

docker run imagename -- will run in attached mode (basically will run on the forgrounde and standard conole our ouput). (CTRL + C for exiting)

docker run -d imagename -- run conatiner in detached mode (runs in the background)

docker attch idofcontainer (agin attach the conatiner back)

docker stop containername

docker rm containername
